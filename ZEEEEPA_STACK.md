# Zeeeepa Stack

## Overview

The Zeeeepa Stack is a comprehensive collection of tools designed to streamline development workflows, enhance code quality, and improve deployment processes. This document provides an overview of each component in the stack and how they work together to create a powerful development ecosystem.

## Quick Start

To deploy the entire Zeeeepa stack on a fresh WSL2 instance, run:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Zeeeepa/ctrlplane/main/deploy-zeeeepa-robust.sh | bash
```

This script will:
1. Install all necessary dependencies
2. Clone all repositories
3. Set up each component
4. Configure automatic startup in WSL2

## Integration and Workflows

The Zeeeepa Stack components work together to create a seamless development experience:

1. **Development Workflow**:
   - Write code and create a pull request
   - `co-reviewer` automatically reviews the code
   - `tldr` generates a summary of the changes
   - `pkg.pr.new` creates a preview release for testing

2. **Deployment Workflow**:
   - Merge approved pull requests
   - `ctrlplane` orchestrates the deployment
   - `ctrlc-cli` provides command-line control
   - Monitor deployment status and health

3. **AI Integration**:
   - `weave` provides AI capabilities for applications
   - Integrate machine learning models into your services
   - Track experiments and model performance

## Management

After deployment, you can manage the Zeeeepa Stack using the `stack.sh` script:

```bash
# Start all services
~/zeeeepa-stack/stack.sh start

# Stop all services
~/zeeeepa-stack/stack.sh stop

# Restart all services
~/zeeeepa-stack/stack.sh restart

# Check status
~/zeeeepa-stack/stack.sh status
```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **Docker services not starting**:
   - Check Docker daemon status: `sudo systemctl status docker`
   - Ensure you have permissions: `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER`
   - Restart Docker: `sudo systemctl restart docker`

2. **Node.js dependency issues**:
   - Clear npm/pnpm cache: `pnpm store prune`
   - Reinstall dependencies: `rm -rf node_modules && pnpm install`

3. **Python environment problems**:
   - Recreate virtual environment: `rm -rf .venv && python3 -m venv .venv`
   - Update pip: `pip install --upgrade pip`

4. **Deployment script errors**:
   - Check the deployment log: `cat ~/zeeeepa-stack/deployment.log`
   - Ensure all prerequisites are installed
   - Try running specific component setup manually

## Conclusion

The Zeeeepa Stack provides a comprehensive set of tools for modern software development, from code review to deployment. By integrating these components, you can create a powerful, efficient development workflow that improves code quality and accelerates delivery.

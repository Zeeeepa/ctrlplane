   - weave provides insights into AI components
   - Automated tests run against the preview releases

3. **Deployment Phase**:
   - ctrlplane orchestrates the deployment process
   - ctrlc-cli provides command-line control over deployments
   - Monitoring and feedback loop back to development

## How the Stack Works Together

The Zeeeepa stack creates a seamless development workflow:

1. **Development**: Developers work on code and create pull requests
2. **Review**: co-reviewer and tldr assist with code review by providing automated analysis and summaries
3. **Testing**: pkg.pr.new creates preview releases for testing
4. **Automation**: probot automates GitHub workflows
5. **Deployment**: ctrlplane and ctrlc-cli handle deployment orchestration
6. **Monitoring**: weave provides insights into AI components

## Integration Points

### GitHub Integration

Several components integrate directly with GitHub:
- **probot**: Provides the foundation for GitHub App integration
- **co-reviewer**: Analyzes pull requests and provides feedback
- **tldr**: Summarizes pull request changes
- **pkg.pr.new**: Creates preview releases for pull requests

### Deployment Pipeline

The deployment components work together:
- **ctrlplane**: Orchestrates the deployment process
- **ctrlc-cli**: Provides command-line control
- **pkg.pr.new**: Generates artifacts for deployment

### AI Components

AI-powered tools enhance the development process:
- **weave**: Provides AI toolkit and insights
- **tldr**: Uses AI for summarization
- **co-reviewer**: Employs AI for code analysis

## Deployment Instructions

For a complete deployment of the Zeeeepa stack, use the provided deployment script:

```bash
./deploy-zeeeepa.sh
```

This script will:
1. Check for all required dependencies
2. Clone and set up all components
3. Configure the necessary environment
4. Set up WSL2 integration with startup prompt

After deployment, you can start the stack with:

```bash
~/zeeeepa-stack/stack.sh
```

When starting your WSL2 instance, you'll be prompted with "Do You Want To Run CtrlPlane Stack? Y/N". Pressing Y will start all services.

## Best Practices

**Example Workflow**:
1. Contributor submits a pull request
2. co-reviewer checks for code quality and adherence to project standards
3. tldr summarizes the changes for maintainers
4. pkg.pr.new creates a preview release for community testing
5. After community feedback and approval, ctrlplane deploys the changes
6. probot updates issue status and notifies stakeholders

### AI Development Team

A team focused on AI development can leverage:

**Example Workflow**:
1. Data scientist updates an AI model
2. weave provides insights into model performance
3. tldr summarizes the changes for the team
4. pkg.pr.new creates a preview release for testing
5. After validation, ctrlplane deploys the model to production
6. weave monitors production performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Docker services not starting**: 
   - Ensure Docker is running and you have sufficient permissions
   - Check Docker logs: `docker logs <container_name>`
   - Verify port availability: `netstat -tuln | grep <port_number>`
   - Try restarting Docker: `sudo systemctl restart docker`

2. **Dependency conflicts**: 
   - Make sure you have the correct versions of Node.js, pnpm, Go, and Python
   - Use nvm, pyenv, or similar tools to manage multiple versions
   - Check the error logs in `$ZEEEEPA_BASE_DIR/deployment.log`

3. **Port conflicts**: 
   - Check if any of the required ports are already in use
   - Modify the Docker Compose files to use different ports
   - Stop conflicting services before starting the stack

4. **Permission issues**:
   - Ensure you have write permissions to the installation directory
   - For Docker issues, make sure your user is in the docker group
   - Check file permissions with `ls -la`

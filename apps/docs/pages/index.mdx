# Introduction

The Ultimate Continuous Deployment Solution.

## What is Ctrl Plane?

Ctrlplane is a flexible and powerful deployment orchestration platform designed
to streamline and automate your software release process. It complements your
existing CI/CD tools by providing centralized management, automated triggers,
and seamless integrations.

## Why Ctrlplane?

Modern software development often involves complex, multi-stage deployment
pipelines that span across diverse environments and platforms. Managing these
pipelines manually can quickly become overwhelming, leading to errors,
inconsistencies, and delays. Ctrlplane addresses these challenges by providing
a centralized platform to orchestrate, automate, and streamline your entire
deployment process.

- **Multiple Environments:** If your application needs to be deployed across
  development, testing, staging, and production environments, Ctrlplane
  simplifies the management of these environments and the transitions between
  them.
- **Diverse Targets:** Whether you're deploying to Kubernetes
  clusters, cloud functions, virtual machines, or custom infrastructure,
  Ctrlplane allows you to manage all your targets from a single platform.
- **Sophisticated Workflows:** If your deployment process involves multiple
  steps like testing, code analysis, security scanning, and approvals, Ctrlplane
  helps you orchestrate these workflows with ease.
- **Integration with CI/CD Tools:** Ctrlplane integrates seamlessly with popular
  CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, and GitHub Actions, allowing you to
  trigger deployments automatically based on your existing pipelines.

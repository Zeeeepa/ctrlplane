# Target Metadata

Target metadata in Ctrlplane are key-value pairs that provide a flexible way to
categorize and organize your deployment targets. They play a crucial role in
defining deployment strategies, filtering targets, and applying configurations
selectively.

## Configs vs Metadata

In Ctrlplane, it's important to understand the distinction between configs and
metadata, as they serve different purposes and are used in different contexts.
This distinction is similar to the difference between the `spec` and `metadata`
sections in Kubernetes.

### Configs

Configs are essential for interacting with the target and should be standardized
across all types of targets. This standardization ensures that if the same
pipeline is given two different targets of the same kind, it can use the
properties in the config to interact with them consistently.

In some cases, you might need additional data outside the standard context to
determine how to interact with the target. In such scenarios, it is acceptable
to include this extra data in the config, but it should be limited to variants
of a given target and should not impact the primary configuration or behavior.

In Ctrlplane, configs are used within CI/CD pipelines to interact with targets.
They define how to deploy or provision the target. It is crucial that values in
the config are used to guide these interactions and not to store arbitrary
metadata.

**Examples of Configs:**

This is how the kubernetes schema currently defines interacting to a kubernetes
cluster. Thes properties are required for a pipeline to connect to clusters.

```yaml
name: my-kubernetes-cluster
cluster:
  endpoint: https://...
  certificateAuthorityData: ...
```

For clusters hosted on Google Cloud (or any cloud provider), you might want to
include metadata about the project associated with the cluster. This metadata
can then be used in the pipeline to generate the necessary access token for
authenticating with the cluster.

### Metadata

Metadata in Ctrlplane is used to provide additional information about a target.
It consists of key-value pairs that help categorize and organize targets.
Metadata is not used to define the behavior or configuration of the target but
rather to describe it.

**Examples of Metadata:**

- `region: us-west`
- `role: web-server`
- `tier: frontend`

**When to Use Metadata:**

- To group targets by specific attributes (e.g., environment, region).
- To filter and select targets for deployment or management tasks.
- To apply variable values to specific targets during deployment.
- To provide descriptive information that helps in organizing and querying
  targets.

### Summary

- **Metadata**: Descriptive information used for categorization, organization,
  and filtering. It does not affect the target's behavior.
- **Configs**: Operational parameters and desired state definitions that dictate
  how the target should function, used in CI/CD pipelines for interacting with
  targets.

By understanding the difference between metadata and configs, you can
effectively organize and manage your deployment targets in Ctrlplane, ensuring
that each target is properly described and configured according to your
requirements.

## Understanding Target Metadata

Metadata is attached to targets, allowing you to group and select targets based
on various criteria. They are particularly useful for:

- Organizing targets by environment, region, or purpose
- Applying configurations to specific groups of targets
- Filtering targets for deployment or management tasks
- Applying variable values to specific targets during deployment

## How Metadata Works in Ctrlplane

1. **Definition**: Metadata are defined as key-value pairs on individual
   targets.
2. **Flexibility**: You can assign multiple key-value pairs to a single target.
3. **Querying**: Ctrlplane allows you to query and filter targets based on their
   metadata.
4. **Selective Application**: Use metadata to apply configurations or run
   deployments on specific subsets of targets.

## Examples of Target Metadata

Here are some common examples of how you might use metadata in Ctrlplane:

```yaml
environment: production
region: us-west
role: web-server
tier: frontend
---
environment: staging
region: eu-central
role: database
tier: backend
```

## Best Practices for Using Metadata

1. **Consistency**: Establish a consistent metadata scheme across your
   organization.
2. **Granularity**: Use metadata that provide the right level of detail for your
   needs.
3. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of your metadata taxonomy.
4. **Avoid Overloading**: Don't try to encode too much information in a single
   metadata key.
5. **Regular Review**: Periodically review and update your metadata strategy as
   your infrastructure evolves.

By effectively using target metadata in Ctrlplane, you can create more flexible,
manageable, and scalable deployment strategies that adapt to your organization's
evolving needs.

## Special Labels

In Ctrlplane, we have special labels that can be added to targets to enhance the
user experience in the UI. These labels do not change the core functionality of
Ctrlplane but provide additional features and visual cues for better usability.

| Label                         | Description                                                                                                                                     |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ctrlplane/links`             | Provides a set of links related to the target. The value should be a JSON object where the keys are the link names and the values are the URLs. |
| `ctrlplane/created-by-job-id` | UUID of the Ctrlplane Job that created the target.                                                                                              |
| `ctrlplane/external-id`       | An external identifier for the target, which can be used to correlate the target with resources in other systems.                               |
| `ctrlplane/cloud-platform`    | The cloud platform the target is running on (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).                                                                            |
| `ctrlplane/region`            | The geographical region or data center location where the target is deployed.                                                                   |
| `ctrlplane/parent-target-id`  | The UUID of the parent target, if the target is a child resource of another target.                                                             |

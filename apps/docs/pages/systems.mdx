# Systems

In Ctrlplane, a system serves as a high-level category or grouping for your
deployments. A system encompasses a set of related deployments that share common
characteristics, such as the same environments and environment policies.

## Why Use Systems?

Systems offer several benefits in organizing and managing your deployment
pipelines:

1. **Logical Grouping:** Systems help you logically categorize deployments based
   on their shared attributes or purpose.
2. **Consistent Environments:** All deployments within a system utilize the same
   set of environments, ensuring a standardized workflow across related
   projects.
3. **Unified Policies:** Systems apply the same environment policies to all
   contained deployments, simplifying governance and ensuring consistent
   controls.
4. **Streamlined Management:** By centralizing the configuration of environments
   and policies at the system level, you can manage multiple deployments more
   efficiently.

## How Systems Work

1. **Creation:** You create a system and define the environments that it will
   encompass (e.g., QA, Staging, Production).
2. **Policy Configuration:** You configure the environment policies that will
   apply to all deployments within the system.
3. **Deployment Association:** You associate your deployments with the
   appropriate system, ensuring they inherit the defined environments and
   policies.

## Key Points

- Systems provide a high-level structure for categorizing deployments.
- Systems ensure that related deployments share the same environments and
  policies.
- Systems simplify management by centralizing configuration.

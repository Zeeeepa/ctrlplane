# Google Workflows

The Google Cloud Workflows Job Agent in Ctrlplane integrates seamlessly with
Google Cloud Workflows, Google's serverless orchestration service. It empowers
you to trigger your Google Cloud Workflows directly from Ctrlplane, responding
to events such as new software releases, new target discoveries, or
updates to existing targets. This integration combines the flexibility and
management capabilities of Ctrlplane with the power and scalability of Google
Cloud Workflows.

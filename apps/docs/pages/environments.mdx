# Environments

In Ctrlplane, an environment serves as a logical grouping of targets.
Think of environments as distinct stages or phases within your software release
process. Common examples include:

- **QA (Quality Assurance):** An environment dedicated to thorough testing and
  validation before broader deployment.
- **Staging:** A pre-production environment that closely mirrors your live
  system for final checks and performance tuning.
- **Production:** Your live environment where the application is accessible to
  end users.

By organizing your targets into environments, you gain several
benefits:

- **Clear Separation:** You can clearly delineate which targets
  belong to which stage of your pipeline.
- **Version Control:** You can easily manage different versions of your software
  in different environments, allowing for gradual rollouts and controlled
  validation.
- **Policy Enforcement:** You can apply specific policies and approvals to
  transitions between environments, ensuring compliance and minimizing risk.

## Environment Policies

Environments in Ctrlplane support Environment Policies. These policies provide
configurable settings to govern how deployments move from one environment to the
next. Environment Policies help you:

- **Enforce Approvals:** Require manual approval before promoting a deployment
  to a higher environment (e.g., from Staging to Production).
- **Define Time Windows:** Restrict deployments to specific time periods (e.g.,
  only during off-peak hours).
- **Set Deployment Limits:** Cap the number of concurrent deployments or the
  total number of deployments within a given timeframe.
- **Semver/Regex Validation:** Validate the version of the software being
  deployed against a regular expression or semantic versioning (Semver) pattern.

## Assigning Targets to Environments

Targets are added to environments using labels. You define labels on
your targets, and your environment configuration includes filters
that match those labels. When a new target is registered, Ctrlplane
automatically checks if its labels match any environment filters. If so, the
target is automatically added to the corresponding environment, and
any associated workflows are triggered.

## Key Points

- Environments provide logical structure and control over your deployment
  pipeline.
- Environment Policies enhance governance and security by defining rules for
  transitions.
- Labels offer a flexible way to dynamically associate targets with
  environments.

# Deployment Strategies for a Scalable SaaS Platform

A growing SaaS company offers a platform with varying customer needs for data
isolation and security. Some customers require strict isolation in a
single-tenant model, while others prioritize cost-efficiency and are comfortable
with a multi-tenant model. Additionally, some customers may have unique
compliance requirements that necessitate a shared-tenant model with enhanced
isolation. The challenge lies in providing flexible deployment options to cater
to these diverse needs while ensuring scalability, security, and compliance
across the platform.

Ctrlplane's flexible architecture enables the implementation of different tenant
models to cater to varying customer requirements:

- Multi-Tenant Deployment:

  - Targets: Multiple customers share the same infrastructure
    resources (e.g., Kubernetes cluster, database).
  - Environments: Environments like "Staging" and "Production" are shared across
    all customers.
  - Workflows: Standard deployment workflows are used for all customers,
    ensuring consistency and efficiency.
  - Variables: System-level variables are used for common configurations, while
    customer-specific variables can be used for minor customizations.
  - Benefits: Cost-effective, easier to manage, suitable for customers with
    standard security and compliance needs.

- Single-Tenant Deployment:

  - Targets: Each customer gets their own dedicated infrastructure
    resources, ensuring complete isolation.
  - Environments: Separate environments are created for each customer, allowing
    for customized configurations and isolated testing.
  - Workflows: Deployment workflows can be tailored to specific customer
    requirements or compliance needs.
  - Variables: Customer-specific variables are used extensively to customize the
    environment and application settings.
  - Benefits: Highest level of security and isolation, ideal for customers with
    strict data privacy or regulatory requirements.

- Shared-Tenant Deployment:
  - Targets: Multiple customers share some infrastructure resources
    (e.g., database servers), while others are dedicated (e.g., application
    servers).
  - Environments: Shared environments are used for some stages of the pipeline,
    while dedicated environments are used for others.
  - Workflows: Workflows can be configured to handle both shared and dedicated
    resources, ensuring proper isolation where needed.
  - Variables: A combination of system-level, deployment-level, and per-target
    variables is used to manage shared and dedicated configurations.
  - Benefits: Balances the cost-effectiveness of multi-tenancy with the
    isolation benefits of single-tenancy, suitable for customers with moderate
    security and compliance needs.

- Dynamic Provisioning: Ctrlplane can automatically provision new single-tenant
  environments as new customers sign up, scaling the platform seamlessly.
- Automated Workflows: Standardized workflows can be used for common tasks like
  software updates and maintenance, regardless of the tenant model.
- Policy Enforcement: Environment policies can be configured to enforce specific
  security or compliance requirements for each tenant model.

## Example

A SaaS provider uses Ctrlplane to offer different deployment options to its
customers. Small businesses choose the cost-effective multi-tenant model, while
large enterprises opt for single-tenant deployments for enhanced security.
Government agencies, with specific compliance requirements, choose the
shared-tenant model to achieve a balance between cost and isolation. Ctrlplane
enables the SaaS provider to efficiently manage all these different deployment
models from a single platform, ensuring a seamless experience for all customers.

# Isolation and Simplified Deployments

In large organizations, application developers often don't have
direct access or deep knowledge of the underlying infrastructure their code runs
on. They focus on developing features and fixing bugs, not managing the
intricacies of targets and environments.

- **Seamless Scalability:** As new targets are added (e.g., new
  Kubernetes clusters in different regions), Ctrlplane automatically integrates
  them into the existing pipelines. This means that developers don't need to
  make any changes to their workflows and infrastructure teams don't need to
  worry about manually add targets for the new infrastructure.
- **Abstraction:** Ctrlplane abstracts away the complexities of deployment
  targets, allowing developers to interact with environments (e.g., "QA,"
  "Staging," "Production") without needing to understand the underlying
  infrastructure details.
- **Standardized Pipelines:** Ctrlplane enables the creation of reusable and
  standardized pipelines that developers can use to deploy their code to any
  environment without modification. This simplifies the deployment process and
  reduces the risk of errors.
- **Self-Service Deployments:** Developers can trigger deployments to specific
  environments themselves through Ctrlplane's UI or API, without relying on
  operations teams. This improves developer autonomy and accelerates the
  development cycle.
- **Status Visibility:** Ctrlplane provides developers with real-time feedback
  on the status and progress of their deployments, giving them confidence that
  their code is being deployed correctly.

## Example

A developer working on a new feature for a web application can simply select the
"QA" environment in Ctrlplane and trigger the deployment. Ctrlplane handles the
rest, deploying the code to the appropriate infrastructure (e.g., a Kubernetes
cluster) and running any necessary tests. The developer can then monitor the
deployment status and logs in Ctrlplane, ensuring that the new feature is
working as expected. Meanwhile, the infrastructure team can add new Kubernetes
clusters to the "QA" environment without requiring any changes from the
developer. This streamlined process allows both teams to focus on their core
tasks while still ensuring that the application is deployed seamlessly to all
relevant targets.

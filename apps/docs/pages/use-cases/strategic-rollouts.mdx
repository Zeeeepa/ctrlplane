# Strategic Rollouts with Gradual Deployment and Controlled Validation

A company is launching a major update to its flagship software application. They
want to minimize the risk of any issues impacting all users at once. The goal is
to roll out the update gradually, starting with a small subset of users, then
expanding to larger groups over time. This approach allows for thorough testing
and validation in real-world scenarios, ensuring a smooth transition and
minimizing potential disruptions.

Ctrlplane enables strategic rollouts through a combination of environments, targets, workflows, and policies:

- Environments: Multiple environments are created to represent different stages of the rollout, such as:
- Canary: A small percentage of users (e.g., 5%) receive the update first.
- Early Adopters: A larger group of users (e.g., 20%) who opt-in to receive the update early.
- General Availability: The update is rolled out to the remaining users.
- Targets: Targets are defined to represent the different groups of users or infrastructure that will receive the update at each stage.
- Workflows: Workflows are configured to automate the deployment process, gradually promoting the update from one environment to the next based on predefined criteria (e.g., successful testing, user feedback).
- Policies: Environment policies are used to control the transition between environments, requiring approvals or automated checks before proceeding.

- Gradual Rollout: Ctrlplane allows you to define a custom rollout schedule,
  specifying the percentage of environments to include at each stage and the
  time intervals between stages. For example, you could start with 5% of users
  in the Canary environment, then increase to 20% after a week, and finally roll
  out to 100% after another week.
- Targeted Deployment: You can use target labels to target specific
  groups of users (e.g., based on region, subscription level, or usage
  patterns).
- Monitoring and Feedback: Ctrlplane integrates with monitoring tools to track
  the performance of the update in each environment, allowing you to identify
  and address any issues before they impact a larger audience.
- Rollback: If problems are detected, Ctrlplane can automatically roll back the
  update to a previous stable version.

## Example

A social media company uses Ctrlplane to launch a new feature. They start by
deploying it to a small canary group of users. After a week of positive feedback
and no major issues, they expand the rollout to early adopters. After another
successful week, the feature is made available to all users. Throughout the
process, the company closely monitors the performance and user feedback,
ensuring a smooth and successful launch.
